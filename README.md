# Rogue-Portfolio-Core
Internal portfolio tracking platform that captures investment forecasts, compares forecast vs actual performance, surfaces risk via deterministic flags, and enforces investor action
# Project Rogue

Project Rogue is an internal portfolio tracking and founder engagement platform.

Its core purpose is to **capture the original business plan at investment date (forecast)** and continuously compare it against **actual performance** from quarterly founder updates, in order to surface risk early and force documented investor action.

This is a decision-support system for investors.  
It is not predictive analytics. It is not a CRM.

## Core Principles

- **Forecast vs Actual is the spine**
  Every company is evaluated against the agreed business plan, not vibes.

- **Deterministic logic**
  Status and red flags are rule-based and reproducible. No opaque AI scoring in MVP.

- **Judgment stays human**
  The system surfaces facts and deviations. Investors decide and must document actions.

- **Immutable history**
  Forecasts, actuals, and flags are versioned and auditable. No silent rewrites.

## What the Platform Does

### At Investment
- Capture a structured, quarterly **forecast curve** (revenue, burn, traction)
- Lock Forecast v1 as the reference business plan

### Every Quarter
- Collect founder-reported actuals via a secure submission link
- Compare actuals to forecast for the relevant quarter
- Trigger deterministic red flags when thresholds are breached

### For Investors / IC
- Show portfolio health at a glance
- Visualize **forecast vs actual** over time
- Surface companies that require attention
- Require notes when flags are acknowledged or resolved

## What This Is NOT

- ❌ Not a predictive model
- ❌ Not a founder scoring system
- ❌ Not peer benchmarking in MVP
- ❌ Not real-time financial integrations
- ❌ Not automated decision-making

Those are deliberate non-goals.
